<strong>Bio:</strong>

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in <a href = "https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/foras-feasa/">An Foras Feasa</a>, Maynooth University, Ireland. I research photographs from the 19th century; my specific interest is in tracing photographic circulation through structured data. I am also interested in data analysis and visualization. A short résumé, with the most recent work, follows.
