      200: "Vinayak Das Gupta teaches in the Department of English at Shiv Nadar University. His work moves between literature, infrastructure, and digital systems—thinking through archives, public memory, and the afterlives of media. He has worked on projects like Bichitra, Anvay, and Recalling Jewish Calcutta, and writes often about care, decay, and failure as forms of attention. This biography, like most of his projects, is a fragment, not a summary.",
      300: "Vinayak Das Gupta is a writer, researcher, and teacher based at Shiv Nadar University. His work moves between literature, memory, infrastructure, and digital humanities. He is interested in things that don’t quite work: fragile archives, decaying platforms, mislabelled photographs. He has created public memory projects, built tools for Bengali topic modelling, and written about the aesthetics and ethics of preservation. Much of his work sits at the intersection of attention and failure—what we try to hold, and what slips through."
