    <h1>5. Super Pad</h1>

    <p>When I was five or six, I started a business. I would gather discarded paper from around the house — the unused backs of letters, old bills, empty margins of school notebooks — and cut them into smaller pieces. I’d bind them with thread or staples, sometimes with ribbon, and make covers from leftover chart paper or cardboard. Then I’d decorate them: hand-drawn borders, coloured titles, sometimes a badly-glued picture cut out from a magazine. I sold them to my parents (the only available market) for 10 paise each. It was a pure profit business. My only investment was time, glue, and excitement.</p>
        
    <p>I called them <em>Super Pads</em>.</p>

    <p>These little notebooks were too small to contain big ideas. They were for everyday things, trivial things, things that you wouldn't put elsewhere. Below are a few of my writings that never found place in more formal publications. I am happy to let them exist as they are.</p>
