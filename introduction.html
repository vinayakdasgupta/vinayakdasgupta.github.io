    <h1>1. Introduction</h1>

    <p>I’ve come to realise that my writing hasn’t only changed because I’ve read more or thought harder. It’s changed because I’ve built things—things like digital archives, public memory projects, topic modelling tools, and collaborative infrastructures. These projects didn’t just support my research; they transformed how I think.</p>

    <p>When I worked on Bichitra, a digital variorum of Rabindranath Tagore’s work, I saw firsthand how messy and unstable the idea of an “original text” can be. That experience gave me a deep respect for the gaps in archives—the things that can’t be neatly stored or versioned. Later, with Letters of 1916 and Battle of Mount Street Bridge, I learned how much the design of an interface shapes the kinds of questions people can ask. These weren’t just technical platforms; they were interpretive spaces. That awareness—that form and meaning are always entangled—shows up in pieces like <em>Memories and Mixed-Media</em>, where I write about what happens when archives fall apart and we’re left piecing together memory through cinema, anecdote, and imagination.</p>

    <p><em>Jewish Calcutta, Recalled</em> was a turning point. It was only in late 2019 that I experienced, first hand, the fragility of technical systems. The website had a malware attack and the content could not be retrieved. That project made me think differently about care—about what it means to hold stories that are not your own, and to build systems that might not last. I wrote about my experience in the volume <em>Learning by Doing</em>. The project didn’t just inform the content of my writing; it shifted the tone. It made me more attentive to voice, to collaboration, and to the ethics of visibility. That shift carries over into <em>Validity and Verifiability</em>, where I try to name the problem: that most institutional systems still don’t know how to recognise digital work, especially when it’s collective, public-facing, or infrastructural.</p>

    <p>I’ve seen this firsthand in projects like <em>Humanities at Scale</em>, which tried to create multilingual teaching resources, and in my own development of <em>Anvay</em>, a topic modelling tool for Bengali texts. These are research projects, but they’re also kinds of writing—writing through code, interface, and community. By the time I wrote <em>Obsolescence</em>, I found myself less interested in what’s broken and more in how we care for things that were never built to last forever. That essay is, in many ways, a culmination: a way of thinking about systems—archival, technical, institutional—not as stable frameworks but as fragile machines that need attention, adaptation, and care.</p>

    <p>Across all these works, the questions have stayed close: How do we remember? What gets lost? What kinds of scholarly labour go unseen? But the way I’ve approached them has changed, shaped at every turn by the projects that have taught me how to look.</p>
