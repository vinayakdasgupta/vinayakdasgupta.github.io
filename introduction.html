    <h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>This site began as a place to gather work that did not sit easily elsewhere. It includes projects I have developed, talks I have given, essays I have written, and pieces that are still in progress. Some entries are formal; others are more reflective. I have included both.</p> <p>It is not arranged around a single theme. Different pages take up different concerns. They are connected by the questions I have returned to, rather than by any fixed outcome. You are welcome to move through the site in any sequence.</p> <p>I have tried to keep the structure simple. The aim is to make the work available, not to guide interpretation. If something seems unfinished, it may be. That has never seemed a reason to leave it out.</p>
