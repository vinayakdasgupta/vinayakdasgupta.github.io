    <h1>Dead Archives and the Ethics of Care</h1>

    <section class="blog-post">

      <p>In 2014, I curated a project called <em>Recalling Jewish Calcutta</em>, a digital public memory initiative dedicated to preserving traces of the city’s once-flourishing Jewish community. What we collected were fragments: photographs without captions, oral testimonies strained by distance and forgetting, objects severed from institutional record. Even in its making, the archive revealed itself as precarious. In 2021, the site was hacked and most of the material was lost, surviving only in scattered backups and partial remnants. This experience made clear to me that the work of memory is not the work of preservation; it is the work of survival. It is from this recognition that this essay departs. It addresses the condition of archives, particularly digital ones, when they no longer secure stability or completeness. The archive, when considered in this way, does not fail when it fragments or decays. The dead archive refers to an archival field that persists after the collapse of its sustaining structures. It survives in fragmentary, latent form, animated neither by active preservation nor by functional retrieval. Death here is survival in an altered and spectral state. The condition of deadness described here is both metaphorical and technical. Spectrality signals the archive’s afterlife beyond institutional frameworks and coherent narratives. Yet death also names a technical state, as seen in the context of digital preservation, where "dark archives" refer to repositories rendered inaccessible, awaiting uncertain futures. The dead archive persists between these registers: as a haunted memory and as a material system withdrawn from circulation.</p>

<p>The figure of the dead archive differs from other conceptualisations of archival breakdown. Unlike Derrida’s <em>archive fever</em>, which describes the internal drive toward both preservation and destruction inherent to the archive itself, deadness refers to a material and temporal state after systemic collapse, when preservation is no longer an active force. Similarly, while Ann Stoler’s notion of <em>colonial aphasia</em> foregrounds structural forgetting and active erasure, the dead archive names its survival in fractured, spectral forms. It also departs from the concept of ruination: ruins are monumental and visible, while dead archives often persist below thresholds of visibility, latency without spectacle. Nor is the dead archive simply synonymous with the dark archive of digital preservation. While dark archives are deliberately sequestered, awaiting reactivation, dead archives are often inadvertently severed from systems of access, surviving by accident. Deadness, in this sense, names a broader and more precarious condition: survival without guarantees, endurance beyond institutional frameworks, memory carried by fragments rather than secured by systems.</p>

<p>If dead archives persist through disruption rather than through coherent preservation, then it becomes necessary to ask how survival itself has been conceptualised within cultural memory. The idea that memory endures through fragmentary and latent persistence, has a longer history. It is to this lineage that I now turn, beginning with Aby Warburg’s work on <em>Nachleben</em> and the survival of forms. Through his notion of <em>Nachleben</em> and the unfinished project of the <em>Mnemosyne Atlas</em>, Warburg developed a model of cultural memory that foregrounds the persistence of forms across disruption and crisis. Survival, in this sense, is the endurance of gestures, images, and emotional charges in altered, often fractured states. Within archival practice, survival shifts the focus from securing stable memory to recognising the persistence of traces. The dead archive is composed of fragments, broken records, corrupted metadata, and partial remains—forms of survival that emerge from the collapse of original systems of order and reference. The temporality of the dead archive differs from the linear continuity imagined by traditional archival work. Survival introduces a delayed, irregular rhythm: fragments exist in latency, awaiting conditions under which they may become legible again, though recognition is no longer tied to their original contexts. Walter Benjamin’s notion of the "now of recognisability" clarifies this dynamic and extends Warburg’s insight into the temporal irregularities of survival. For Benjamin, meaning does not endure as a stable property of objects or records; instead, it erupts unpredictably when historical conditions create the possibility of recognition. Fragments persist in a latent state, disconnected from their original contexts, until a moment of crisis or awakening renders them legible once more. This recognition is not a restoration of original meaning, but a charged encounter shaped by the needs and pressures of the present. Like Warburg’s survivals, archival remains do not form a continuous historical thread but gather in constellations, activated by shifting patterns of attention. This irregular temporality already gestures toward a spectral logic of survival: the persistence of traces that await reactivation, rather than the maintenance of stable continuity: a sensibility later explored in theories of hauntology. The dead archive, in this sense, is not a static repository but a charged field where latent meanings await their moment of reactivation.</p>

<p>Working with dead archives demands a change in method. It is necessary to relinquish the ideal of recovery and attend to the fragmentary with care and patience. The task is to read the traces that survive, acknowledging their estrangement and their endurance. This approach calls for a rethinking of the aims of historical inquiry. If memory persists through survival, then the ambition to restore completeness must be set aside. Historical understanding emerges from the fragmentary and the incomplete. The dead archive is the medium through which survival gives rise to new forms of meaning.</p>

<p>The dead archive situates itself within a broader tradition that values the fragment as a site of meaning. In Romantic thought, figures such as Schlegel and Novalis regarded the fragment as a form that revealed the impossibility of totality. In modernist aesthetics, the fragment became a principle of composition itself. Yet the archival fragment differs from these literary and artistic fragments. It is not composed for effect. It results from rupture, loss, and decay. Its incompleteness is not a technique but a condition. The materiality of the archive further complicates this notion. The decomposition of digital archives differs fundamentally from the degradation of physical ones. Where brittle paper and faded ink betray the slowness of chemical time, corrupted files and bit rot disclose a different, often invisible process of decay. Media archaeologists such as Wolfgang Ernst and Jussi Parikka have drawn attention to these material dimensions, describing the archive as a fragile assemblage of contingent technologies. The dead archive, in this sense, is not an abstraction. It is the material residue of exhausted infrastructures. Temporality, too, demands further reflection. Benjamin’s model of the sudden recognisability of the fragment remains a vital point of departure, but it can be supplemented by other temporal figures. Temporality, too, demands further reflection. The dead archive does not follow a single temporal rhythm. Instead, it gathers multiple strains of disrupted time: sudden appearance, slow attrition, lingering pressure, unrealised potential. Lauren Berlant’s concept of "slow death" describes the gradual attrition of systems, the wearing down of structures through prolonged exposure to precarity. Elizabeth Freeman’s idea of "temporal drag" suggests that past forms do not simply pass away but exert delayed and resistant pulls upon the present. Mark Fisher’s notion of hauntology evokes futures that have failed to materialise but continue to cast shadows over the now. Together, these figures outline the temporality of the dead archive: not a linear progression from origin to end, but a field where different velocities, delays, and spectral pressures converge. The dead archive lives in the slippage between breakdown and endurance, between the remnants of what was and the unrealised possibilities of what might have been.</p>

<p>If the dead archive disrupts the temporal rhythms of traditional memory, it also calls into question the ethics and affective modes appropriate to its care. Working within such conditions requires more than technical intervention. It demands a deeper attentiveness to survival as an ongoing relation. To engage with dead archives is not only a methodological question. It raises ethical and affective demands. The scholar or curator who encounters fragments must confront the limits of their authority. There is no mandate to restore what has been broken. There is only the task of care: a willingness to bear witness to survival without forcing it into narrative or system. This ethics of care draws attention to the responsibilities owed to fragments. Sharon Leon’s work on care in digital humanities reminds us that maintenance is not merely technical. It is affective and relational. Care must also be understood within broader critiques of archival practice. Tara McPherson has shown how digital systems can encode racial and structural biases, while Zoe Todd reminds us that Indigenous approaches to memory often resist archival capture altogether. An ethics of care for dead archives must remain attentive to the exclusions and erasures that have shaped what survives, and what has been allowed to decay. To maintain a dead archive is to acknowledge its precariousness without seeking to erase it. There is also an affective texture to this engagement. The dead archive may induce melancholy, as Svetlana Boym has described in relation to nostalgia. Yet it may also offer a form of liberation. In relinquishing the fantasy of completeness, one makes space for alternative modes of memory: modes that embrace uncertainty, latency, and the unknown.</p>

<p>Survival, in this frame, becomes less a matter of human will and more an ecology of traces. Non-human perspectives, such as those offered by Jane Bennett and Anna Tsing, allow one to conceive of archives as living environments, populated not only by human memories but by decaying materials, drifting data, and emergent, unforeseen patterns. The archive may even be thought of as haunted. Avery Gordon’s notion of "ghostly matters" reminds us that the past does not disappear cleanly into history. Instead, unresolved struggles, unfulfilled desires, and suppressed memories linger as spectral presences, shaping the present from within its absences. The dead archive, in this sense, is not only a collection of broken fragments. It is a haunted space, animated by the unfinished business of the past. What endures in the dead archive is not simply material residue, but the pressure of meanings deferred and forgotten. To encounter the dead archive is therefore to confront not just loss, but the persistence of that which refuses to be fully consigned to the past. Ghosts are not inert. They are demands, unfinished stories, and latent claims on the present.</p>

<p>The dead archive invites a transformation in the epistemological foundations of historical work. It demands that incompleteness be accepted as a condition of possibility. The ambition to produce total histories, seamless narratives, or exhaustive catalogues gives way to a practice oriented around fragments, survivals, and partial recognitions. This is not a retreat from historical inquiry. It is a reorientation. It recognises that survival carries its own forms of knowledge, which do not rely upon stability or continuity. It proposes that memory itself may reside most fully not in what has been preserved intact, but in what endures through brokenness. Living with the dead archive means embracing a future in which memory is not guaranteed and meaning emerges precariously. It is to accept that historical disciplines, pedagogical practices, and public memory projects must be remade in light of survival rather than preservation. In this future, the dead archive is not a relic of failure. It is a living field, in which fragments continue to speak, endure, and alter the present in ways that cannot be scripted in advance. Recognising survival in fragmented forms does not romanticise decay. It acknowledges a historical and material condition produced by violence, neglect, and loss. The aim is not to aestheticise brokenness, but to attend carefully to what remains, without erasing the circumstances of its partial survival. This approach does not negate the urgency of reparative or decolonial archival work. Rather, it insists that acts of repair must reckon with the realities of fragmentation and erasure, without imagining that the original conditions can be restored intact. Survival is the ground upon which reparative practices must build.</p>
