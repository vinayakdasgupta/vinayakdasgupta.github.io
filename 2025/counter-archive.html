    <h1>Building a Counter-Archive: Storytelling After Collapse in Disco Elysium</h1>

    <section class="blog-post">
      <p><em>Disco Elysium</em> stages a world in collapse. Its city, Revachol, stands as a husk of failed revolutions. Its protagonist is a man already broken, whose mind speaks in discordant voices, where memory has failed and identity has fractured. The storytelling that emerges from this world is a negotiation with fragments. This fragmentation is structural and systemic, and one, I would also argue, that is deeply necessary. <em>Disco Elysium</em> reveals storytelling as a practice of assembling partial meanings from failure. In doing so, it aligns itself with a wider constellation of contemporary works that resist the totality of narrative, whose texts unfold through broken memories and the acceptance that coherence is no longer available, if it ever was.</p>

<p>Storytelling in fragments arises when certain conditions make coherence impossible. It is not only a matter of form. It responds to the collapse of structures that once allowed for coherence to seem possible. As Theodor Adorno wrote, “to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric.” Traditional forms of coherence become obscene in the face of historical trauma. To write in fragments, then, is not a weakness; it is an ethical obligation. The movement through Revachol is not a reconstruction of a coherent city. It drifts across broken institutions, failed revolutions, and corrupted memories, offering no point from which the world could be seen in full.</p>

<p><em>Disco Elysium</em> follows a broken detective tasked with solving a murder. Yet the investigation is never only about the crime. As the detective moves through Revachol, the case becomes a way of tracing the collapse of a city and of a self. The murder remains the official reason for inquiry, but the deeper task is to survive in a world that no longer offers stable meaning. The detective gathers testimony, listens to unreliable memories, and reconstructs partial truths, but no final resolution repairs what has been broken. Even when the case reaches its conclusion, the wounds of the world remain open. The plot does not restore order. It exposes the impossibility of restoration. The detective is not alone in his movements through Revachol. Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi serves as a companion, an observer, and often a counterpoint. He represents reason and restraint, offering a contrast to the detective’s broken self. Where the protagonist hallucinates and contradicts himself, Kim maintains discipline and clarity. Yet even he is not immune to the pressures of the city. Revachol wears down certainty in everyone who passes through it. Kim’s quiet patience, his occasional silences, and the rare glimpses of doubt that surface over time, reveal that even the most disciplined voice cannot stand entirely apart from collapse. His presence does not repair the world. It shows how difficult it is to move through ruin without being changed.</p>

<p>In following the detective and Kim through Revachol, the player experiences a slow movement through ruins and partial encounters. The experience of the player might be similar to that in <em>The Rings of Saturn</em>, where Sebald wanders through abandoned railways, forgotten battles, decaying estates, gathering fragments without forcing them into a system. Yet fragmentation in <em>Disco Elysium</em> is not a purely narrative condition; it reaches into the structure of play itself. The player is given agency: to choose ideologies, to pursue certain lines of thought, to try to assemble coherence. But the game resists these efforts. No matter how the player navigates, Revachol remains fractured. Ideological certainty does not repair the world. Moral clarity does not rescue the detective. Even agency itself is folded into the broken landscape, revealing the limits of mastery over ruin. The fractures in <em>Disco Elysium</em> are not confined to narrative structure or player choice. They reach deeper, into the very fabric of language. In Paul Celan’s later poetry, words hesitate, syntax collapses, meaning stammers in the aftermath of disaster. Language no longer bears witness straightforwardly; it carries the injury it cannot heal. In <em>Disco Elysium</em>, the detective's mind is divided into competing faculties: Inland Empire speaks for dream and intuition, Half Light for paranoia and fear, Empathy for the felt emotions of others. Each faculty operates with its own logic, pulling perception and judgment in different directions. They do not build a unified consciousness. They produce a cacophony of broken logics, hallucinated fears, and contradictory insights. Thought itself fractures under the weight of a world that cannot be reassembled. The response might be similar to that found in Kate Zambreno’s works, where she does not complete narrative arcs or resolve doubts; in a sense, she embodies this condition. She documents failure, doubt, and provisional movements as modes of being. <em>Disco Elysium</em> likewise does not move towards redemption. It persists through minor acts of attention, bearing witness to moments of clarity without demanding that they be pieced into a greater whole. What we are left with is an image of grief, yet not grief elevated into transcendence. Here, we may take lessons from Anne Carson, who turns grief into a novel that carries its wound without sealing it.</p>

<p>Even so, <em>Disco Elysium</em> is not merely solemn. It remains insistently, grotesquely funny. The absurdities of the Thought Cabinet, the surreal dialogue with one’s own instincts, the ludicrous collapses of the body, produce a tragicomic texture that deepens rather than deflects the sense of ruin. The fragment contains grief, absurdity, mourning, and also laughter. Humour is not the only thing that emerges from collapse. The game also allows for encounters with forms of life that would have remained invisible within coherent worlds. Through what appears to be an incoherent, dreamlike quest, the detective may discover the Insulindian Phasmid, a gigantic sentient creature hidden in the reeds. The Phasmid appears because of its ruin. It is not coherence recovered, but an opening into forms of life that rational investigation could not previously see. The possibility of the Phasmid belongs to the same world as the collapse, not outside it.</p>

<p>To tell in fragments is to remain honest to the conditions that produced them. It is to resist the false promise of coherence, the fantasy of restoration. In this, <em>Disco Elysium</em> stands alongside Sebald, Carson, Celan, and Zambreno. It participates in the same exposure, the same pressure, and the same necessity. It is not a question of style. It is a question of truth. Comparisons between <em>Disco Elysium</em> and literary modernism or postmodernism are not new. Critics have noted the game's affinities with Kafka’s absurd systems, Pynchon’s paranoid structures, and the broader collapse of coherent narrative found across twentieth-century literature. Yet the concern here is not to locate <em>Disco Elysium</em> within an aesthetic lineage. It is to treat fragmentation as an ethical necessity. Fragmentary storytelling emerges because certain conditions -- trauma, collapse, irretrievable loss -- leave no other truthful way to narrate the world.</p>

<p>The fragment is not a failure of storytelling. It becomes its ethical core. In Sebald’s ruins, Carson’s grief, Celan’s stammered language, and Zambreno’s unfinished movements, the fragment refuses redemption but preserves what remains. These fragments gather into something closer to a counter-archive. They do not stabilise what has been broken, and they do not conceal the damage. Sebald’s history does not conclude; Carson’s mourning does not heal; Celan’s language does not carry intact meaning; Zambreno’s life does not resolve into narrative closure. In <em>Disco Elysium</em>, the player collects traces, testimonies, failures of memory, but no master story emerges. Choices do not complete the world. They reveal more of its irreparable nature. The discovery of the Phasmid makes this clear. It does not mark the return of sense. It appears because the detective has surrendered the fantasy of coherence. Rational mastery cannot find it. Only the broken intuitions of Inland Empire lead to its emergence. The Phasmid is not a solution. It is an opening into other forms of life that could not exist within a repaired world. The game’s counter-archive isn’t built through triumph but through accumulation: failed checks, half-remembered dialogues, and the Thought Cabinet’s dissonant voices. Like Benjamin’s ragpicker, the player gathers what the world has discarded, not to restore it, but to let it speak in its brokenness. Agamben’s account of testimony sharpens this further. To witness after catastrophe is not to recover what was lost. It is to bear the weight of its disappearance. The archive, properly understood, is not a treasury of restoration but a record of what can no longer be restored. <em>Disco Elysium</em> builds this kind of counter-archive. It holds together fragments without lying about their incompletion.</p>

<p>To gather fragments in this way is not to glorify ruin; it is to build a different kind of archive. One that preserves what remains without forcing it into false coherence. Survival does not depend on restoring lost structures. It depends on holding the fracture open, and caring for what has been broken without trying to repair it. In the company of Sebald, Carson, Celan, Zambreno, Adorno, Benjamin, and Agamben, <em>Disco Elysium</em> refuses the dream of healing collapse. It keeps collapse visible. It preserves memory as incomplete. It builds a counter-archive that does not close wounds, but carries them forward, and in doing so, tells the only kind of story that remains possible.</p>
