    <h1>Digital Humanities Didn’t Begin with the Computer</h1>

    <section class="blog-post">
        
        <p>[This formed the basis of a plenary lecture I gave at IIT-Jodhpur in 2024.]</p>
      
        <p>Every discipline has its origin myth. For Digital Humanities, it is often the story of Father Roberto Busa and the <em>Index Thomisticus</em>: a monumental mid-20th century effort to encode the works of Thomas Aquinas using IBM punch cards. It is an impressive origin story that really writes itself: how a clergyman met and tamed the machine. It is the story many of us learn in the first decade of the 21st century.</p>
      
        <p>But what if this isn’t where it began? What if tying the origins of a field to a machine — a particular instantiation of technology at a particular moment — obscures something older, more essential?</p>
      
        <p>My concern is not with the figure of Busa, but with what his positioning implies: that Digital Humanities is defined by its relationship to the modern computer. That computation and the computer are one and the same. This, I would argue, is both historically and conceptually misleading.</p>
      
        <p>Computation precedes the computer. Long before circuits and silicon, there were systems of reckoning. The abacus, Napier’s bones, Leibniz’s calculator, Babbage’s Analytical Engine — each a step in a lineage of mathematical imagination. The computer is not the origin of computation; it is one of its many manifestations. If we think of Digital Humanities as computationally inflected humanistic inquiry, then its history cannot begin with the mid-twentieth century. It must begin much earlier, in the moments when pattern, structure, and formal constraint became tools for thinking in the humanities.</p>
      
        <p>Take literature, for instance. The claim that literature resists mathematical thinking — that it is unrepeatable, affective, beyond system — is, I suspect, more myth than fact. Literature has long been shaped by form, rule, and design. The sonnet is a constraint. So is tragedy in five acts. So is the rhyme scheme of Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Mathematical imagination is not an intrusion into literature; it is one of its substrates.</p>
      
        <p>Consider Vladimir Propp’s <em>Morphology of the Folktale</em> (1928). From a modest corpus of one hundred Russian fairy tales, Propp extracted a system of 31 functions, basic narrative moves that always occur in a fixed order. It is a kind of proto-algorithmic thinking. A recognition that stories are not infinite, but patterned. That imagination has structure.</p>
      
        <p>Or consider the Oulipo group, founded in the 1960s, a gathering of writers and mathematicians who used constraint as a source of creative energy. For them, the literary work was a combinatorial engine. Form came first. Meaning would follow, if it could.</p>
      
        <p>If this is computation — understood as rule-based generation and systemic variation — then surely it existed long before the computer. And if Digital Humanities is about these modes of inquiry, then it too predates its name.</p>
      
        <p><strong>So why does this matter?</strong></p>
      
        <p>Because origin stories shape expectations. When we tie a field to a specific technology, we make it vulnerable to that technology’s limits, its obsolescence, its market logics. We confuse the machine with the method. We risk reducing thought to tool-use.</p>
      
        <p>We also risk absurdity. If the presence of a computer defines Digital Humanities, then every action on a device — from writing a document to checking email — becomes a DH act. This is clearly untenable. Not everything done on a computer is Digital Humanities. Nor must Digital Humanities always involve a computer.</p>
      
        <p>What matters is the disposition. A willingness to think structurally, to formalise ambiguity, to trace patterns in what seems singular. To ask: what else might this text or this image or this object reveal if we look at it sideways?</p>
      
        <p>And here, the computer is simply one more lens. Powerful, yes. But not foundational.</p>
      
        <p>I have no desire to unseat Busa. His work was remarkable, and symbolic in all the right ways. But perhaps it is time to write a different prelude to the field — one that begins not with machines, but with a form of thought. Not with a moment, but with a method.</p>
      
        <p><strong>Digital Humanities, then, is not defined by the digital. It is animated by the mathematical. And mathematics, quietly, but intently, has always been part of the humanities.</strong></p>
